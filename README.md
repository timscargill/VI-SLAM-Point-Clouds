# VI-SLAM Point Clouds
This repository introduces **VIP500**, a dataset of 4772 VI-SLAM point clouds that covers 500 different object and environment configurations. We also provide **VIP500-D**, an accompanying dataset of 20 RGB-D point clouds of the object classes and shapes in VIP500, for comparison purposes.

This work is under review, therefore we currently provide representative samples of the data. The full datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

# Datasets
Upon paper acceptance, a Google Drive link will be provided for the full VIP500 and VIP500-D datasets.
